** PROJECT SETUP

- Project setup done with bower and npm
- It contains grunt tasks to build the sass into css and to watch for errors
on the javascript when it detects changes on the files

** ASSUMPTIONS

- When receiving the json file with the new match, it only contains one match.

** NOTES

- As the application is really small, there's only one angular module, the same applies to the controllers.
